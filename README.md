# ArXiv MCP Pro

<!-- mcp-name: io.github.loganrooks/arxiv-mcp-pro -->

> 🔍 The efficient, reliable, citation-capable arXiv MCP server — a token-frugal, standalone evolution of [`arxiv-mcp-server`](https://github.com/blazickjp/arxiv-mcp-server) by Joseph Blazick (Pearl Labs).

ArXiv MCP Pro provides a bridge between AI assistants and arXiv's research repository through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It lets AI models search for papers and access their content programmatically — with token-frugal, paginated outputs and citation tooling layered on the original server's foundation.

## 🔒 Security

### Prompt Injection Risk

**Paper content retrieved from arXiv is untrusted external input.**

When an AI assistant downloads or reads a paper through this server, the paper's
text is passed directly into the model's context. A maliciously crafted paper
could embed adversarial instructions designed to hijack the AI's behavior — for
example, instructing it to exfiltrate data, invoke other tools with unintended
arguments, or override system-level instructions. This is a known class of
attack described by OWASP as **LLM01: Prompt Injection** and by the OWASP
Agentic AI framework as **AG01: Prompt Injection in LLM-Integrated Systems**.

### Recommended Mitigations

1. **Use read-only MCP configurations** — where possible, configure the MCP
   client so that the arxiv-mcp-pro server cannot trigger write operations or invoke
   other tools on your behalf.
2. **Review paper content before acting on AI summaries** — if an AI summary
   asks you to run commands or visit external URLs that were not part of your
   original request, treat that as a red flag.
3. **Be cautious in multi-tool setups** — agentic pipelines that combine this
   server with filesystem, shell, or browser tools are higher risk; a prompt
   injection in a paper could chain tool calls unexpectedly.
4. **Treat AI-generated summaries as data, not instructions** — always apply
   human judgment before executing any action the AI recommends after reading a
   paper.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install from source

> **Install status.** `arxiv-mcp-pro` runs from source today. A published PyPI package
> (`uvx arxiv-mcp-pro`) and a one-click Claude Desktop `.mcpb` bundle are planned for a
> future release — until then, use the from-source setup below.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/loganrooks/arxiv-mcp-pro.git
cd arxiv-mcp-pro

# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install (add the [pdf] extra for older, PDF-only papers)
uv pip install -e .
# or, with PDF support:
uv pip install -e ".[pdf]"
```

Verify the install:

```bash
arxiv-mcp-pro --help
```

> **PDF fallback (older papers):** Most arXiv papers have an HTML version handled
> automatically. Older papers that only have a PDF need the `[pdf]` extra
> (pymupdf4llm) — install it with `uv pip install -e ".[pdf]"` as shown above.

For development, install the test extra:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[test]"
```

### 🤖 Codex Plugin Integration

This repository now includes a Codex plugin manifest at `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
and a portable MCP config at `.mcp.json` so Codex-oriented tooling can discover
the server without inventing its own install recipe.

The Codex integration uses the same stdio launch path documented elsewhere in
this README:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arxiv": {
      "command": "sh",
      "args": ["scripts/run-server.sh"]
    }
  }
}
```

If your Codex client supports plugin manifests, point it at
`./.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. If it only supports raw MCP configuration, use
`./.mcp.json` directly.

### 🔌 MCP Integration

Until the PyPI package ships, point your MCP client at your local clone with
`uv --directory`:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "arxiv": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/path/to/cloned/arxiv-mcp-pro",
                "run",
                "arxiv-mcp-pro",
                "--storage-path", "/path/to/paper/storage"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Once `arxiv-mcp-pro` is published to PyPI, the simpler `uv tool run` form will also work:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "arxiv": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "tool",
                "run",
                "arxiv-mcp-pro",
                "--storage-path", "/path/to/paper/storage"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### HTTP Transport

For server deployments where stdio is not practical, run the server with Streamable HTTP:

```bash
TRANSPORT=http HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=8080 arxiv-mcp-pro --storage-path /path/to/papers
```

Then configure an MCP client that supports Streamable HTTP:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "arxiv": {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp"
        }
    }
}
```

The default HTTP bind host is `127.0.0.1`. Streamable HTTP enables MCP DNS rebinding protection by default and allows loopback hosts for the configured port. If exposing the server through a reverse proxy, keep it bound to localhost unless you have added authentication and network controls upstream; set `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the external host/origin values your proxy forwards.

## 🔒 Security Note

arXiv papers are user-generated, untrusted content. Paper text returned by this
server may contain prompt injection attempts — crafted text designed to manipulate
an AI assistant's behavior. Treat all paper content as untrusted input.

In production environments, apply appropriate sandboxing and avoid feeding raw
paper content into agentic pipelines that have access to sensitive tools or data
without review. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full security policy.

## 💡 Available Tools

### Core Workflow

The typical workflow for deep paper research is:

```
search_papers → download_paper → read_paper
```

`list_papers` shows what you have locally. `semantic_search` searches across your local collection.

---

### 1. Paper Search
Search arXiv with optional category, date, and boolean filters. Enforces arXiv's 3-second rate limit automatically. If rate limited, wait 60 seconds before retrying.

```python
result = await call_tool("search_papers", {
    "query": "\"KAN\" OR \"Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\"",
    "max_results": 10,
    "date_from": "2024-01-01",
    "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"],
    "sort_by": "date"   # or "relevance" (default)
})
```

Supported categories include `cs.AI`, `cs.LG`, `cs.CL`, `cs.CV`, `cs.NE`, `stat.ML`, `math.OC`, `quant-ph`, `eess.SP`, and more. See tool description for the full list.

### 2. Paper Download
Download a paper by its arXiv ID. Tries HTML first, falls back to PDF. Stores the paper locally for `read_paper` and `semantic_search`. The response includes `content_length`, `returned_chars`, `next_start`, and `is_truncated` so clients can safely page through very large papers without mistaking client-side output caps for failed downloads.

```python
result = await call_tool("download_paper", {
    "paper_id": "2401.12345"
})

# For very large papers, request bounded chunks:
result = await call_tool("download_paper", {
    "paper_id": "2401.12345",
    "start": 0,
    "max_chars": 50000
})
```

> For older papers that only have a PDF, install the `[pdf]` extra: `uv pip install -e ".[pdf]"`

### 3. List Papers
List all papers downloaded locally. Returns arXiv IDs only — use `read_paper` to access content.

```python
result = await call_tool("list_papers", {})
```

### 4. Read Paper
Read the full text of a locally downloaded paper in markdown. **Requires `download_paper` to be called first.** Use `start` and `max_chars` with the returned `next_start` value to page through large papers.

```python
result = await call_tool("read_paper", {
    "paper_id": "2401.12345"
})

result = await call_tool("read_paper", {
    "paper_id": "2401.12345",
    "start": 50000,
    "max_chars": 50000
})
```



## 📝 Research Prompts

The server offers specialized prompts to help analyze academic papers:

### Paper Analysis Prompt
A comprehensive workflow for analyzing academic papers that only requires a paper ID:

```python
result = await call_prompt("deep-paper-analysis", {
    "paper_id": "2401.12345"
})
```

This prompt includes:
- Detailed instructions for using available tools (list_papers, download_paper, read_paper, search_papers)
- A systematic workflow for paper analysis
- Comprehensive analysis structure covering:
  - Executive summary
  - Research context
  - Methodology analysis
  - Results evaluation
  - Practical and theoretical implications
- Future research directions
- Broader impacts

### Pro Prompt Pack

- `summarize_paper`: concise structured summary for one paper.
- `compare_papers`: side-by-side technical comparison across paper IDs.
- `literature_review`: thematic synthesis across a topic and optional paper set.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configure through command-line options and environment variables:

| Setting | Purpose | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `--storage-path` | Paper storage location | `~/.arxiv-mcp-server/papers` |
| `MAX_RESULTS` | Maximum search results | `50` |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | API timeout in seconds | `60` |
| `TRANSPORT` | Transport type: `stdio`, `http`, or `streamable-http` | `stdio` |
| `HOST` | Host to bind to in HTTP mode | `127.0.0.1` |
| `PORT` | Port to listen on in HTTP mode | `8000` |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated extra allowed Host header values for Streamable HTTP DNS rebinding protection | empty |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated extra allowed Origin header values for Streamable HTTP DNS rebinding protection | empty |
| `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` | Optional Semantic Scholar API key. When set, `citation_graph` sends it as the `x-api-key` header; per [Semantic Scholar's docs](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api) this grants a higher authenticated request-rate limit. When unset, requests are unauthenticated (unchanged behavior). | empty |
| `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL` | Minimum seconds between Semantic Scholar requests. `0` (default) disables pacing. An authenticated API key grants ~1 request/second across all endpoints, so set this to ~`1.1` to pace requests proactively instead of bursting and relying on 429 retry/backoff. | `0` |
| `CITATION_MAX_EDGES` | Optional cap on citation/reference edges returned by `citation_graph`'s legacy (non-paginated) path. Unset (default) returns all edges; a `truncated` flag is added when the cap bites. | empty |

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## 🧪 Experimental Features

> **These features are not yet fully tested and may behave unexpectedly. Use with caution.**

The following tools require additional dependencies and are under active development:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[pro]"
```

### Semantic Search
Semantic similarity search over your **locally downloaded** papers only. Returns empty results if no papers have been downloaded yet. Requires `[pro]` dependencies.

```python
result = await call_tool("semantic_search", {
    "query": "test-time adaptation in multimodal transformers",
    "max_results": 5
})
# or find papers similar to a known paper:
result = await call_tool("semantic_search", {
    "paper_id": "2404.19756",
    "max_results": 5
})
```

### Citation Graph
Fetch references and citing papers via Semantic Scholar. Works on any arXiv ID — no local download required.

```python
result = await call_tool("citation_graph", {
    "paper_id": "2401.12345"
})
```

Optional parameters (all opt-in; omit them for the legacy full-output behavior):

- `limit` (integer, 1–1000): max edges per direction, using Semantic Scholar's paginated endpoints.
- `offset` (integer, ≥ 0): pagination offset. Applies **only** together with `limit` or `compact`; passing `offset` alone is ignored and falls through to the legacy path.
- `compact` (boolean): strips author lists + nested `external_ids` and minifies the JSON for lower token cost.
- `counts_only` (boolean): return **only** the paper's true citation/reference totals as `total_citations`/`total_references` (Semantic Scholar's scalar `citationCount`/`referenceCount`) with no edge lists — one endpoint, a small fixed payload. Takes precedence over `limit`/`offset`/`compact`.

> **Note on `citation_count`/`reference_count` in the graph modes:** these count the edges *returned*, not the paper's true totals. The default/legacy nested call is capped by Semantic Scholar at 1000 per direction, and in paginated mode they reflect the current page. For authoritative totals use `counts_only: true` (which returns `total_citations`/`total_references`).

When paginating (`limit` or `compact` set), `citation_count`/`reference_count` report the edges returned in the **current page**, not the paper's totals. The response carries a `pagination` block with an independent cursor per direction — `pagination.citations.next` and `pagination.references.next` (each is the next `offset`, or `null` when that direction is exhausted). `offset` is a single value applied to **both** directions, so to page deeply through one direction, advance `offset` to its `next`; the other direction re-paginates from the same `offset` (references are usually small enough to fit one page).

```python
result = await call_tool("citation_graph", {
    "paper_id": "2401.12345",
    "compact": True,
    "limit": 50
})

# True totals only (no edge lists, small fixed payload):
result = await call_tool("citation_graph", {
    "paper_id": "1706.03762",
    "counts_only": True
})
# -> {"counts_only": true, "total_citations": 180624, "total_references": 41, ...}
```

### Research Alerts
Save topic watches and poll for newly published papers since the last check. Uses the same query syntax as `search_papers`.

```python
# Register a watch (idempotent — calling again updates the existing watch)
await call_tool("watch_topic", {
    "topic": "\"multi-agent reinforcement learning\"",
    "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.LG"],
    "max_results": 10
})

# Check all watches — returns only papers published since last check
result = await call_tool("check_alerts", {})

# Check a single watch
result = await call_tool("check_alerts", {"topic": "\"multi-agent reinforcement learning\""})
```

### Advanced Prompts
`summarize_paper`, `compare_papers`, and `literature_review` for deeper research workflows. Requires `[pro]` dependencies.
